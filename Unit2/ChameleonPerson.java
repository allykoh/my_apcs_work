//A chameleon person is someone who is:

//Blending (camouflaged) during daytime hours (7:00 to 19:00),

//Colorful (visible) during twilight (19:00 to 22:00 or 5:00 to 7:00),

//Changing colors during nighttime hours (before 5:00 or after 22:00).

//Given an activity state (int state):

//state = 0: Blending

//state = 1: Colorful

//state = 2: Changing colors

//Define the function
//  boolean isChameleon(float hour, int state)
//which returns true if the person’s activity does not match the expected
// pattern for that time of day (i.e., not behaving like a “chameleon”). 
//Implement the function with a single logical/comparison expression.
